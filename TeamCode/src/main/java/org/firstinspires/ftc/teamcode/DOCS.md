# FAQ
Robot shut down randomly? Why?
This is a known issue and we are trying to work out the source of it, please, if you get this, write down what you did before it happened so we can work out the source.

How to align robot in auto?
Just RTFM.

Am I on the latest version of the code?
Check the telemetry, upon init of any OpMode it should output the git tag of the code. You can then either ask the programmer or check it yourself against the latest version on git, if it says dirty on the end, complain to the programmer because that's not a version intended for competition.
